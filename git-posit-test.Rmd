## Intro paragraph

Example of document that will be automatically published to Connect as new commits
are being pushed to the Github repo

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## New content
This content should appear automatically on the Connect published after this change 
is pushed to Github. This new content appeared at `r Sys.time()`

## Another paragraph
Adding another paragraph as my previous change was not picked-up.

## Testing automatic updates
updates are driven by the `manifest.json` file, so `rsconnect::WriteManifest` has
to be run before pushing any commit to the Github repo.

## Yes another section because changes are not being picked up...
